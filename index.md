My name is Leon Silva, I'm a Senior Software Engineer and I'm currently studying a Master's degree in Computer Science.

This blog is also intended to serve as a brain dump for some of the stuff that I do and would like to keep as a reference for the future.

Some of my current interests:
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- Haskell programming
- Fedora Linux
